# StreamChat mod by mini_bomba

A simple chat client for Twitch (and maybe Youtube later) put into Minecraft 1.8.9's chat box!

**NOTE: This project is still work-in-progress and is lacking many of the planned features. They will be added soon™**

## Configuration

Since this is still a WiP project, configs can only be edited manually.
To make the mod work, an application token must be generated on Twitch and pasted into the configs.
Channel name must also be added. Listening on multiple stream chats at once is supported.

**Ingame method of configuration coming soon™**

## Usage

After loading a world (either single- or multiplayer), any messages sent in any of the configured stream chats will be relayed to 
your player's local chat.

A command to send messages from minecraft to the stream chat is planned.
