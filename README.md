# StreamChat mod by mini_bomba

A simple chat client for Twitch put into Minecraft 1.8.9's chat box!

## Installation

The mod can be downloaded from a release or the artifacts of a Github Actions job.
After downloading, this mod can be installed simply by putting the .jar file in the mods folder of your minecraft installation.
It is located in `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` on Windows and `~/.minecraft` on Linux.

## Configuration

**NOTE: All commands listed are NOT Twitch chat commands, and should be run in your Minecraft client, not the Twitch chat window.**

First, generate & set the Twitch token. To do that, simply run `/twitch token`.
A prompt for granting permission to your Twitch account will appear in your browser.
After granting permission, you will be redirected to a locahost page. If permission was granted
within around 120 seconds, the token will automatically be saved (as indicated by the âœ… emoji in your browser and a confirmation message in your minecraft client).
If you got a connection refused page instead, you can still manually set the token by copying it from the url (the `access_token` query param)
and use the command `/twitch settoken <token>`.
If the prompt window did not appear, you can use [this link](https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=q7s0qfrigoczrj1a1cltcebjx95q8g&redirect_uri=http://localhost:39571&scope=chat:read+chat:edit).

After configuring the token, use the command `/twitch enable` to enable the Twitch chat and run `/twitch chat join <channel name>` for every channe chat you want to see in-game.

If you want to send messages from the in-game chat to your stream chat, run `/twitch chat select <channel name>` to select the channel to send messages to.
Then you can use `/twitchchat <your message>` or `/tc <your message>` to send a message.

## Usage

After loading a world (either single- or multiplayer), any messages sent in any of the configured stream chats will be relayed to 
your player's local chat.

If you selected a channel in the configuration section, you can use `/tc <message>` to send any message from in-game to your selected stream chat.

You can delete a message by clicking on it in-game and sending the suggested command. Note that the message will stay visible in-game; use F3+D to clear your in-game chat.

All Twitch related configuration commands can be viewed by running `/twitch help`.

## Moderation from Minecraft

Some moderation commands are available from in-game. They are listed below:
* `/twitch delete <channel> <message id>`: Delete the specified message. It is supposed to be entered by clicking on a message in-game, since there is no easy way to get the ID of a message.
* `/twitch clearchat`: Clears the currently selected Twitch Chat. Does not clear the in-game chat; use F3+D to do that.
* `/twitch timeout <user> <duration> [reason]`: Timeouts the given user in the currently selected Twitch Chat. There is no un-timeout command, time the user out for 1 second to do that.
* `/twitch ban <user> [reason]`: Bans the given user in the currently selected Twitch Chat.
* `/twitch unban <user>`: Unbans the given user in the currently selected Twitch Chat.

**NOTE: The mod has no way to verify that an action has been done, and the confirmation messages are always sent, even if the action was not performed on the Twitch servers.**

## Note to self:
Run `setupDecompWorkspace` Gradle task before configuring Gradle project
